Add school and job BBCodes to posts

# Codes

Adds to the composer toolbar a building (job) and university (school) to add to a post like this:
```
[job]
[title]job title[/title]
[type]Full-time[/type]
[dates]start-end[/dates]
[description]
- one
- two
[/description]
[logo]upload institution logo[/logo]
[/job]

[school]
[title]job title[/title]
[type]Full-time[/type]
[dates]start-end[/dates]
[description]
- one
- two
[/description]
[logo]upload institution logo[/logo]
[/school]

```

No CSS styling is included yet. I recommend an external theme component to develop that in the short term.

## Thanks

Based largely on [discourse-formatting-toolbar](https://github.com/iunctis/discourse-formatting-toolbar/).

This adds the ability to have multi-line tags (e.g., `[job] and `[description]).
